Description: This package provides functions for the comprehensive analysis of protein data,
             including various transformation methods, coefficient of variation (CV)
             calculation, and deconvolution using established algorithms like EDec, Rodeo,
             csSAM, and bMIND. It generates detailed HTML reports summarizing CV distributions,
             marker recall rates against gold standards, and cell-type-specific gene expression.
