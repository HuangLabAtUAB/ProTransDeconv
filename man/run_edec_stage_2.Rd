\title{Custom EDec Stage 2 Implementation (Non-negative least squares with bounds 0-1)}
\usage{
run_edec_stage_2(gene_exp_bulk_samples, cell_type_props)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_exp_bulk_samples}{Numeric matrix of bulk gene expression (genes x samples).}

\item{cell_type_props}{Numeric matrix of cell type proportions (samples x cell types).}
}
\value{
A list containing estimated means, standard errors, residuals,
explained variances, and degrees of freedom.
}
\description{
This function estimates average expression profiles of constituent cell types
by solving constrained least squares problems using quadratic programming.
This is a custom implementation inspired by EDec's principles, specifically
enforcing solutions between 0 and 1 (if appropriate for the data type).
