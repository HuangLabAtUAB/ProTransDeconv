\title{Compute Specificity from Deconvolution Means}
\usage{
compute_specificity(mat)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A matrix of estimated gene expression means (genes x cell types).}
}
\value{
A matrix of specificity values (genes x cell types).
}
\description{
Calculates the specificity of each gene for each cell type based on estimated
cell-type-specific gene expression means. Specificity is calculated by
dividing the gene's expression in a given cell type by its total expression across all cell types.
